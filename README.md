This is an app that returns all the flights Between Two cities for the current day. 

It takes two Airport Codes as it's input, a From and a To and returns all of the flights
with the departure time, arrival time, flight number and airline. 

The cities in the display portion of the flights are then clickable to display the weather from
that city. 

The weather currently only works for teh following airports (the most relevant for me...):
LAS
SAN
PDX
SEA
LAX
BUR
OAK
PHX
DFW
MCI
ORD
MSP
DTW
CLE
IAH
MSY
ATL
FLL
MCO
TPA
RSW
MYR
BWI
PIT
PHL
LGA
JFK
BOS
EWR
DSM
AUS
SAC
OMA

More cities/airports may come later though for now thats it.
